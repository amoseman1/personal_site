                hats in my life which have given me the life lessons and experiences to mold
                me into a very adaptable and hard-working individual. Spending most of my
                working life in the hospitality industry, I know what is to be punctual,
                energizing, polite, calm, a multitasker and flexible. My work in the outdoor
                industry has given me the title of teacher, leader, steward, athlete,
                competitor, and risk manager. The volunteering work I do has taught me how
                to be an influencer with integrity, an enthusiastic motivator, and an organized
                and dependable communicator. All of these traits have made my transition
                into a web developer much smoother. The daily collaboration is a crucial part
                of the experience. I can't wait to build some amazing things together.</main></Col>
